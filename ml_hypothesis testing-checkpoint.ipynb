    "Significant predictors: age, bmi, children, and smoker_yes are all statistically significant predictors of charges because their p-values are all much smaller than 0.05.\n",
    "Insignificant predictor: lagged_charges is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.412), which suggests that including the previous value of charges as a predictor does not improve the model."
